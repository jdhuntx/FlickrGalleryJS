This is a photo gallery based on a user's Flickr photosets.  This gallery runs completely client-side, depending only on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery).  The included javascript files do have a dependency on jQuery, but they are not written as jQuery plugins.  To use this code, you will need your own Flickr API key (http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html) and you will need your Flickr UserName.
